# Palindrome-project
This is a python project which reads off a dictionary file and returns all possible palindrome words E.g. nurses run.
# What each file does
Palindromes.py just outputs the number of palindromes and the palindromes in the dictionary file.
Palingrams.py shows all possible palingrams from the dictionary file (A palingram is a phrase with segments of one or more words that reads the same backwards after a permutation of the letters within each segment.-Florida state university)
palingrams_optimized is the optimized version of palingrams.py as palingrams.py would take a couple minutes to output all palingrams where palingrams_optimized takes only a few seconds.
load_dictionary.py is just used to format the '2of4brif.txt' file
